    "1. what are the applications of graph model or Data structure? \n",
    "- When the emphasis is on Pair-wise relationship. \n",
    "- Lets take social media applications:\n",
    "    - Typical application is when a user-follower/ user-friends relationsip in application like \n",
    "        facebook, X, instagram.  \n",
    "    - Course schedule. \n",
    "    - Accounts Merge\n",
    "2. Why cant you use existing data structures or why other datastructures fail to \n",
    "    support these use cases?\n",
    "- The requirement here is to store the relationships between people, and a dependency graph\n",
    " in the case of course schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why cant you use Trees? or why should you think these as graph problems? \n",
    "- The structure of Trees, is that the information flows from root to leaves(Top to bottom). \n",
    "- But, we need a datastructure which could handle the bidirectional flow of information in the case \n",
    "of social media apps. \n",
    "- Course schedule:\n",
    "    - Why should you think this as a directed graph? \n",
    "        - Because there is a dependency associated with the nodes/courses.  \n",
    "    - Why can't you think this as a Tree problem? \n",
    "        - Bcz there can be scenarios where cross and back edges are possible in the course dependencies and trees doesnt support these properties.     \n",
    "4. Why is Accounts Merge a Graph Problem?\n",
    "- Some observations about the problem:\n",
    "    1. The goal is to merge the accounts based on a common email. \n",
    "    2.  \n",
    "- Using hahsmap to solve this?\n",
    "    - \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the structural properties of Tree and Graph?\n",
    "Tree:\n",
    "- In a tree, there should be no cross edges or back edges. \n",
    "- Information flow is pure Top down. \n",
    "- In cases like B-tree indexes, there can exist scenarios where the information/accessing information/exectuion happens from bottom to top, while splitting the parent nodes, but strictly speaking accessing the B+ tree is Top-down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graph:\n",
    "- Information is bidirectional in un-directed graphs. \n",
    "- There can exists cross or back edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Structural and execution properties of a undirected and directed graphs:\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between Tree and a Graph? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Structural properties:\n",
    "- A graph can be represented as a BFS TREE. \n",
    "- A graph can be represented as a DFS TREE. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does the information flow in Graphs vs Trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the time complexity of the graphs:\n",
    "1. So,  I think , this depends on the ways you represent/store the graph. \n",
    "2. But in general it is number of the edges in the graph, to traverse the whole graph. \n",
    "O(E)\n",
    "Adjacency lists :\n",
    "1. Most frequent way of representing the graphs. \n",
